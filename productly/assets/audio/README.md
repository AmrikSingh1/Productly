# Audio Assets

Place your audio files here to be used by the audio player.

## Required Files

The app expects the following file:
- `sample.mp3`: A sample audio file for the audio player demo

You can download a free sample MP3 file from [SoundHelix](https://www.soundhelix.com/audio-examples) or other royalty-free audio sources.

## Note

The `sample.mp3` file is required for the Audio Player feature to work properly. If this file is not present, the audio player will fail to initialize and show an error.
